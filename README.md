# 5-State-Model-Simulator
Multithreaded program to demonstrate a all 4 scheduling algorithms and their five states that are:
* FCFS
* Round Robin
* Shortest Job First
* Shortest Remaining Time First

Each algorithm is running simultaneously using multithreading and each state is written separately communicating via pipes. 
This code has been written in C++ for linux ubuntu OS
